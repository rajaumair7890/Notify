# Notify
A Note taking App for Android having all the features of Keep build with modern Jetpack libraries and Jetpack Compose.

This branch of Notify named version_1.1.0 contains a slight change in main screen UI giving true edge to edge full screen experience
where the seach bar is put on top of notes content and slides up out of the screen when scrolling down and slides back down when the
content is scrolled up, with some basic animation and floating action button reacts to the scroll as well expanding and collapsing with 
respect to scroll directions. The updated apk file is included in app/relesese folder.

Here's the changed UI, you can see the search bar floating on top of content and expanded floating action button.
